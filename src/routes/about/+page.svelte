	<h1>About this Website</h1>

	<h3>Why</h3>
	<p>
		My resume cannot do my projects justice. I need to explain them properly here. Plus since I made this website myself, that to using Svelte, I can easily add new features.
	</p>


	<h3>Challenges I faced</h3>

	<h3>Too much</h3>
	<p>
		It took me three iterations to make this website. I always struggled with trying to make everything. This time I focused on something very simply. In fact, this was going to 
		vanilla js, html and css. I stayed strong but missed Svelte, so thats the only addition so far.
	</p>


	<h3>.nojekyll file</h3>
	<p>
		My app was not able to get some of it's files. It took me so long to find out that the .gitignore wasn't uploading the .nojekyll file which was messing everything up.
