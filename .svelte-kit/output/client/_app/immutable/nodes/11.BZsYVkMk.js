I decided to use Roblox Studio since it took care of the multiplayer stuff so I could just focus on the game. While I was doing my research I realized that the genre of Transforming Robots was lacking. There were no fun games to play there. In the images below you can see
		the transforming animation and car I made for users. You can also see the raycating physics that I used to make the railgun shoot. Lastly, you can see how people can buy in-game
		items using Robux (Roblox&#39;s virutal currency) to buy products.
